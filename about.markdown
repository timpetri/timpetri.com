My name is Tim Petri. I live in NYC and work as a software engineer at Google.  

I studied computer science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. While at school, I interned at Carbon Black (later acquired by VMWare) and Microsoft. 

At the moment, I'm working on bringing the best of Google's visual understanding [to the web](https://9to5google.com/2022/01/14/how-to-search-any-image-on-chrome-desktop-using-google-lens/).

I'm interested in a lot things. AI and machine learning is high up on the list, and especially the recent advances in transformers and large language models. Outside of that, my interersts include AR/VR, health care (in particular computatial genomics and vaccines) and crypto.
